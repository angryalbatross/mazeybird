TODOS:
-Get video ads running as a way to earn gold - need alison's help to install
-Make new levels (maybe 48 to start, 12 per season - then could make new ones for year 2/3 etc...)
-Redo all sprites
-Create different ways for the bird to interact with the environment
--switches that the bird can flip
--torches the bird can pick up to light fire to stuff
--bugs the bird can eat to regain health?
--bigger animals that try to eat the bird?
--fireballs you have to outrun? 
-Play cute feeding animation when you return to the nest -?
