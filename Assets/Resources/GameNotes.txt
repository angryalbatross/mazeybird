Game Overview
This game is supposed to play like flappy bird, except your are playing as a bird
returning home to her nest to feed her chicks. Your goal is to navigate the mazelike
path to your nest without taking too much damage from thorns and brambles.
If you take too much damage you die, and your chicks starve, scary!
