TODOS:
-Make sure that players have to unlock levels sequentially - (currently they could unlock both level 2 and 3 by just paying the cost for 3)
-Get video ads running as a way to earn gold
-Create thumbstick control for moving Player
-implement screen tap to fly
-Make new levels (maybe 48 to start, 12 per season - then could make new ones for year 2/3 etc...)
-Redo all sprites
-Create different backgrounds for different seasons
-Play cute feeding animation when you return to the nest -?
